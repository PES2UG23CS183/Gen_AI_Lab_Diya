# Unit 1 – Model Benchmark Challenge 

This assignment benchmarks different transformer model architectures by forcing them to perform tasks they may or may not be designed for.  
The goal is to observe how architecture impacts model behavior.

The following models are evaluated:
- **BERT** (`bert-base-uncased`) – Encoder-only
- **RoBERTa** (`roberta-base`) – Encoder-only
- **BART** (`facebook/bart-base`) – Encoder–Decoder
